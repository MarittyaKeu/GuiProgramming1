I tested my page using both markup validation services http://validator.w3.org/ and http://validator.nu/ and passed with no error.

The website is a simple introduction using basic web development techniques. It has the basic HTML structure (Doctype declaration, header and body tags, etc.) and contains an index html file, an external stylesheet, an image folder, and Bootstrap. It is being served by UMLs' CS server "weblab.cs.uml.edu". The sidebar has links to the assignments.
