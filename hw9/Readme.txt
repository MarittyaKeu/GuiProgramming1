Assignment 9

For this assignment, we were tasked to design a Scrabble board game in JavaScript. The board was build via tables and classes were added to scoring bonus tiles. I received help from a fellow classmate named Sokthai Tang, specifically implementing the re-rack function. 


Known bugs: The scoring function is a running total of the game score. However, when you drag a tile that has already been place on the tile, it re-adds the tile score. This is something I can probably debug, but unfortunately, I don't have the time.
