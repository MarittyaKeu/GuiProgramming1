Description: For this assignment, we were tasked to style the provided index.html file to a specific style. This must be done without making any changes to the main html file. To do so, I targeted specific elements, classes, and ids. I also used a grid template for the layout. Also, I used margins and paddings to create spacing and alignments. Overall, the homework was fairly easy besides styling the layout of the file.
