The website is a simple introduction using basic web development techniques. It has the basic HTML structure (Doctype declaration, header and body tags, etc.) and contains an index html file, an external stylesheet, an image folder, and Bootstrap. The sidebar has links to the assignments.

For homework 4, we incorporated CSS into our webpage. I created my site using a simple side navbar with links stacked on top of each other.

I tested my page using both markup validation services http://validator.w3.org/ and http://validator.nu/ and passed with no error. Also, I tested my CSS code using w3C CSS Validation service found here http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator and everything came out ok.
